# DevLogs


Welcome to Azm's Dev Logs! With my inspiration master Fron-End Development, I decided to do the #100daysOfCode challenge. 
This way I'll have the practice and also showcase what I'll be coding the next 100 days. I'll be adding a new project everyday!
This site is build using HTML, SCSS and JavaScript.
